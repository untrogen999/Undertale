<!--2019-10-07 ebb: I just updated your schema line so it could find your schema in the GitHub repo! 
Your schema is not in the same file directory with the XML, but is up one directory (in the parent directory), so I added ../
The schema is definitely in a good place in the repo (I wouldn't move it), because the XML in your other directories probably has to reach it.
-->
<!-- 2019-10-28 ama: At some point you moved the schema back into the '<intro&instructions>' directory. I removed Dr. B's addition of '../' so that this XML document is now properly associated with the schema again-->

    <p n="2">One day, a terrible war broke out between the two races.</p>
    <p n="3">After a long battle, the humans were victorious.</p>
    <p n="4">They sealed the monsters underground with a magical spell.</p>

    </instruction>
    <!--ebb: You have stray </instruction> close-tag here which is 
    preventing your XML from being well-formed. Do you want to wrap <instruction> around <GameOver>, or remove it?
    Looking at your schema, apparently <GameOver> can be inside <Intro> and also inside <instruction>, so it's not clear to me how best
    to fix this! Once you deal with it though, your XML is well formed!

    <!-- 2019-10-28 ama: As someone who has not played Undertale and is not very familiar with it, are these multiple characters speaking in the following paragraph? If so, maybe include speaker and speech tags to make this a little easier to read. Or are these the responses from each character if the player tries to name themselves after one of them? A sort of way the developers have created 'reserved words'. -->
