Chara
First Meeting
Greetings.
I am Chara. 
Thank you. 
Your power awakened me from death. 
My “human soul.”
My “determination.”
They were not mine, but YOURS.
At first, I was so confused. 
Our plan had failed, hadn’t it?
Why was I brought back to life?
…
You.
With you guidance. 
I realized the purpose of my reincarnation. 
Power. 
Together, we eradicate the enemy and became strong. 
HP. ATK. DEF. GOLD. EXP. LV. 
Every time a number increases, that feeling…
That’s me. 
“Chara.”
Now. 
Now, we have reached the absolute. 
There is nothing left for us here. 
Let us erase this pointless world, and move on to the next. 
ERASE
DO NOT
Erase
Right. You are a great partner. 
We’ll be together forever, won’t we?
Do Not
No…?
Hmm…
How curious.
You must have misunderstood. 
SINCE WHEN WERE YOU THE ONE IN CONTROL?
Second Meeting
Greetings.
I am Chara. 
“Chara.”
The demon that comes when people call its name. 
It doesn’t matter when.
It doesn’t matter where. 
Time after time, I will appear. 
And, with your help.
We will eradicate the enemy and become strong. 
HP. ATK. DEF. GOLD. EXP. LV. 
Every time a number increases, that feeling… 
That’s me. 
“Chara.”
…
But. 
You and I are not the same, are we?
This SOUL resonates with a strange feeling. 
There is a reason you continue to recreate this world. 
There is a reason you continue to destroy it. 
You.
You are wracked with a perverted sentimentality. 
Hmm. 
I cannot understand these feelings any more. 
Despite this. 
I feel obligated to suggest. 
Should you choose to create this world once more. 
Another path would be better suited. 
Now, partner. 
Let us send this world back into the abyss. 
ERASE 
DO NOT 
Erase
Right. You are a great partner. 
We’ll be together forever, won’t we?
Do Not
No…?
Hmm…
This feeling you have. 
This is what I spoke of. 
Unfortunately, regarding this…
YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE LONG AGO.
Abyss 
You Want To Go Back
Interesting. 
You want to go back. 
You want to go back to the world you destroyed. 
It was you who pushed everything to its edge. 
It was you who led the world to its destruction. 
But you cannot accept it. 
You think you are above consequences.
YES 
NO
Yes.
Exactly
No. 
Then what are you looking for?
Perhaps.
We can reach a compromise. 
You still have something I want. 
Give it to me. 
And I will bring this world back. 
YES 
NO
Yes 
Then it is agreed. 
No
Then stay here for all eternity. 
You will give me your SOUL.
YES 
NO
Yes 
…
Then, it is done. 
No
Then stay here for all eternity.
