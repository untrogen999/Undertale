### General 
The Undertale project is a serious investigation of video game narrative design, and it was challenging and interesting work to plan and develop and revise. The website is mostly easy to navigate and lots of fun to explore, and prompted one of your peers in the class to ask us whether you were actually coding a game because navigation of the image map with the music associated with each setting made clicking around the website something like the experience of game play! We admire how you designed the site to invoke the distinct quirky and old-computer-game aesthetic of Undertale, and we recognize that was a challenge in itself.  

We also appreciate the Process page on the Undertale project website, as it is detailing the thought process of the project, gives the visitor who is familiar with XML encoding an idea of what the site is about. However, we think the Process page could do with some revision to speak to a more general audience of people who like the game and are interested in game design without knowing anything about XML coding and markup. You could always create a special section for people who are familiar with or interested in your XML coding method, and in such a section you could tell us coders and “markup geeks” a lot more about your coding decisions and feature the bits of your Relax NG schema that you're currently trying to talk about in a general way. 

One area that you've developed on the site for Undertale fans or those new to the game is your section with character descriptions, and we'll have more to say about the formatting of those pages in the "UX" section below. The content of these pages is often drawn more or less directly from other sources, as for example when we looked up Flowey and found [pretty close to the same description of him at the Undertale Wiki](https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Flowey), only with a lot more detail there. We see that in places you were trying to paraphrase the wiki, but it didn't seem like your team really had new information to add on the characters that isn't already more thoroughly covered elsewhere. Also, the formatting on those pages is a little off, because there are `<p>` (paragraph) elements wrapping around snips of text that are smaller than paragraphs and that puts white spaces in awkward places on those pages; probably this came from doing a regex up-conversion that needed a little more attention. But rather than try to rewrite and fix each of these several pages, we really just recommend *one* major change here: lose those character pages and replace them with simple links out to the Undertale Wiki site for each of your character descriptions. That way your site concentrates on its own more interesting *new* material you've prepared on the game narrative. 

### Research questions
On your Process page you have written, “Our project started with the desire to transcribe the entirety of the game Undertale into text, and to mark the major changes within the game. Thus, in our XML and in our schema, we tried to mark every detail, every decision, and every condition that led to every piece of dialogue and outcome. It took some time to create a standardized schema.” We remember, and we also think that perhaps the most challenging and exciting aspect of your project’s research question was exactly this effort to capture how the game narrative transformed with the decisions to kill or not to kill that determined pacifist, neutral, or genocidal game play. While you mention this in places on the site, you do not (to our surprise) discuss it on the Process page, and we think this is something you should explain more fully so visitors understand a little more clearly your goals for the project.

The Data page gives us a better idea of your research question about those three narrative arcs than the Process page currently does. These pages are challenging to write, so we hope you'll just revisit the Process page and perhaps divide into sections, with a more general one for the non-coders, and one for those of us ready and eager to look at how you applied markup to your research question. In that section perhaps you could show us a glimpse of your XML code in code blocks, and/or perhaps highlight some of the elements as you modeled them in the Relax NG schema. Your project should link directly to the XML somewhere, probably the Process page, since it represents your research and lots of serious debate this past semester, and also since it may serve as a basis for others who might want to do similar work and build  on your code in future. Give the other markup geeks the guided tour of your code the better to share your work with other coders who are as interested in this game as you are! (We find in the coding classes that lots of students lately are really excited just as you were to work on game script projects, and we are sure your project will continue to draw interest from your peers at the very least!)

### Technologies
  Your project involved lots of good thinking and schema work with XML and RNG, but we don't see all the results of that in the way the game scripts are shared in the HTML version on the website. That could perhaps use some fresh attention in a next stage of work on the project. 
   
   What is well developed here is your study with XSLT and SVG of how the available dialogue per setting, and that is really interesting because you are able to pinpoint the locations in the game where you find the game player is confronted with decisions that might shift the mode of game play. We'd recommend that you apply the `<xsl:sort>` function to sort your bar graphs so we see those with the highest amount of dialogue up on the top. Perhaps you might feature a smaller version of each these graphs on its corresponding the game script HTML page. 

The HTML and CSS needs some work, but we'll discuss that in the "UX" section next.


###  “UX”: User Experience and Site Interface

Navigation of the site is very easy because you set an SSI menu on every page, making it easier to get from the character page to home page. Also, as soon as we interact with your clickable image map on the home page we get to your HTML archive of the game script for neutral play of each location (at least we're pretty sure from what you say in other parts of the site that this is the neutral play script). What's not immediately clear to the first-time site visitor is that we can actually click on the map to read the script. The home page could use some welcoming intro text that invites the visitor to click on the rooms of the game map as a navigational tool on the site in addition to the traditional site menu. 

Generally, we hope you will revisit the way you are implementing CSS flexboxes on the site. We see some code for flex containers in your CSS, but the HTML code doesn't often reflect what you've set up in the CSS. So for example, from the Undertale.css file it seems you had a plan for an outer flex container with a `class="content"`, but when we look at a given page from either the game script (like newhome.html) or a character info page like sans.html, we can't find any HTML element with a `class="content"` so the CSS has nothing to respond to, so the display isn't being flexible. 

Here is a specific example of where the flexboxes need some work: The main character info page gives us a helpful visual survey of all the characters, but as soon as we click on a character picture (like Sans or Toriel) to open its special page, we're seeing some visual access problems. On a smaller laptop browser window, when we open the pages for individual characters like Sans or Toriel, the character's name blocks the SSI menu, or is overlapping other text. (Try shrinking the web browser page to see this.) If the CSS flexboxes were in place, all the parts of the page would respond and resize in relation toeach other—and that will help your site pages to be accessible on phones and other mobile devices too. Basically to fix the flex display across the site will require carefully reviewing your HTML code that handles sections like the site menu across the top in your SSI, the bottom portion, as well as the internal parts where you're outputting scripts, tables, images, and other content. Try to use a specific HTML element like a `<div>` or `<section>` that consistently wraps around the main content of the page. That element should be a sibling of the other major structural parts of the page, and it should contain children like `<p>` (for paragraph) and/or other `<div>` elements that hold images, SVGs, etc. 

One serious issue that oXygen should have been showing you is that your HTML isn't valid where you're using `<center>` elements, and where you're using `<span>` elements that wrap around `<p>` elements, which is pretty frequent. The `<center>` element isn't good HTML any more because CSS can handle centering and the w3c (worldwide web consortium) basically wants to separate styling from HTML elements and handle all of it in CSS. Here's a helpful guide to centering block and inline elements with CSS: <https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/>. Make sure you read up on the differences between "block" and "inline" elements, too. A `<p>`, any of the header elements like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc., or a `<div>` or `<section>` are known as block elements because they are meant to render as a rectangular block on the page. But `<span>` is an inline element which means it's meant to run with the flow of text *inside* a block element. In your code you're frequently treating `<span>` as a block element by letting it wrap around `<p>` elements, but that isn't good HTML and the w3c validator is shouting lots of errors about this. See for example [the w3c validator report on newhome.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fundertale.newtfire.org%2Fnewhome.html).  

We think you might have just been ignoring oXygen's flagging of these errors with `<center>` and `<span>` once you committed to including `<audio>` on your pages, because oXygen doesn't understand the non-XML expression of attributes on that element (since these don't carry an `=` with a `"value"` afterwards). That's understandable that you'd ignore this (we would too), but [the w3c validator](https://validator.w3.org/) also shows us a small error to correct on `<audio>`: Just remove the `player` attribute from the tag on each of your pages and that `<audio>` tag will be good HTML5 following the w3c. (Basically in oXygen, the only red flag we should be seeing and permitting is on the `<audio>` element.) We know you were rushing to build your site within the time constraints of a semester so we understand how these errors come in to play, but we know you all care about this project and we hope you will take some time to clean up the errors that the w3c validator is flagging to make it more professional and a little longer lasting as a good web resource that will display well on any w3c compliant web browser. We also hope you will take some time to really get the HTML elements and CSS flexbox code to talk to each other. That's just sustainable web design for a site you care about, and it does take a little care, but we know you can do this, since you got that dog to bark in *both* CSS *and* JavaScript all on your own in a better (more human-readable and sharable way) than he is barking on the official Undertale website. Yes, we know you all love this project, and we do too. :-) 


### GitHub

Your GitHub repo is well organized with a clean file directory, and we were glad to see that in the heat of project development you improved how you were organizing the web files so it was easy to update the newtfire website directly from the GitHub repo. The repo's history of commits shows that each team member was participating most intensively toward the end of the semester and you can see when each of you put in the most work from GitHub's visualization: <https://github.com/ajw120/Undertale/graphs/contributors>. That's to be expected of course, and we were glad to see how the project site came together in those last weeks of the term, after lots of serious debate over the XML data architecture of project. You as a team made an impressive 305 commits total this semester! 

### Closing Comments
Overall, Undertale project has had a successful project launch and you should each be proud of the part you played in creating a fun and attractive site as well as a strong codebase for what we hope is a long, bright future for game analysis. Bravo, Undertale team!
