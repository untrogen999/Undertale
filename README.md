# Undertale

Site homepage: [https://untrogen999.github.io/Undertale](https://untrogen999.github.io/Undertale)

This repository was created to revive the "Undertale" project and website made in the Fall 2019 semester of
HUMAN-1050, taught at PITT Greensburg.

The original repo was hosted on the personal site of a
previous professor teaching HUMAN-1050; however, the website's owner removed the project's code,
taking down the project's website in the process. Thus, the primary goal for this revival project is to change any files and code
that were reliant on the old infrastructure so that the website lives again using Github Pages.

This project keeps changes to the original repo to the minimum, just enough to make the website
visible on the web again with functioning links.

Other than renaming the "HTML" folder to "docs" and filling this README with, well, text, no other changes needed to be done for this project.

This revival project and all its files are licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).
The original project repo, if you're
interested, is hosted also on Github, but it does not use Github Pages:

# Undertale
RPG (role playing game) that incorporates the idea of human choice, allowing the player to choose how they play the game. Throughout the game, the player can make friends with other characters or rather see them as the enemy. In this project we hope to make a fun and interactive experience for players and site viewers!
