            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <span class="mono">
                <p>Mettaton is a robot with a SOUL and was built by Alphys. Initially an </p>
                <p>entertainment robot turned human killing robot, Mettaton is later revealed to</p>
                 <p>have only acted as such so that Alphys could rescue the Frisk, so she could feel</p>
                  <p>important and become closer to them. Mettaton is the sole television star of the Underground. </p>
            </span>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <span class="mono"> 
                <p>Mettaton originally appears as a gray, large rectangular box with a grid of</p>
                 <p>lights at the top. The grid of lights can change colors, and Mettaton uses these color</p>
                    <p>changes in place of facial expressions. He has four dials at the bottom of</p>
                    <p>his body, and the bottom, he has a single leg which ends in a wheel. He has two</p>
                    <p>segmented robotic arms which end in white gloves. </p></span>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <span class="mono">
                <p>Mettaton is a confident, charismatic, and charming TV host that loves drama,</p>
                 <p> action, and violence. He lives for his ratings and adores performing.</p>
                <p>He shows a rather shallow appreciation for existence at times. However, despite his </p>
                <p>narcissistic personality, he deeply cares about the seemingly positive</p>
               <p> impact his show has had on the creatures of the Underground. </p>
