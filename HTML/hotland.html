         <br />*Well, actually, umm, there's just a tiny issue.
         
         <br />*A long time ago, I made a robot named Mettaton.
         
         <br />*Originally, I built him to be an entertainment robot.
         
         <br />*Uh, you know, like a robotic TV star or something.
         
         <br />*Anyway, recently I decided to make him more useful.
         
         <br />*You know, just some small practical adjustments.
         
         <br />*Like, umm...
         
         <br />*Anti... anti-human combat features?
         
         <br />*Of c-course, when I saw you coming, I immediately decided...
         
         <br />*I have to remove those features!
         
         <br />*Unforunately, I may have made a teensy mistake while doing so.
         
         <br />*And, um...
         
         <br />*Now he's an unstoppable killing machine with a thrist for human blood?
         
         <br />*Ehehehehe...
         
         <br />*Heh.
