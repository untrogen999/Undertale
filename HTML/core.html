         <br />*OH YES. *THERE YOU ARE, DARLING.
         <br />*IT'S TIME TO HAVE OUR LITTLE SHOWDOWN.
         <br />*IT'S TIME TO FINALLY STOP THE "MALFUNCTIONING" ROBOT.
         <br />*...NOT!!!
         <br />*MALFUNCTION? *REPROGRAMMING? *GET REAL.
         <br />*THIS WAS ALL JUST A BIG SHOW.
         <br />*AN ACT.
         <br />*ALPHYS HAS BEEN PLAYING YOU FOR A FOOL THE WHOLE TIME.
         <br />*AS SHE WATCHED YOU ON SCREEN, SHE GREW ATTACHED TO YOUR ADVENTURE.
         <br />*SHE DESPARETLY WANTED TO BE A PART OF IT.
         <br />SO SHE DECIDED TO INSERT HERSELF INTO YOUR STORY.
         <br />*SHE REACTIVATED PUZZLES. *SHE DISABLED ELAVTORS. *SHE ENLISTED ME TO TORMENT YOU.
         <br />*ALL SO SHE COULD SAVE YOU FROM DANGERS THAT DIDN'T EXIST.
         <br />*ALL SO YOU WOULD THINK SHE'S THE GREAT PERSON...
         <br />*THAT SHE'S NOT.
         <br />*AND NOW, IT'S TIME FOR HER FINEST HOUR.
         <br />*AT THIS VERY MOMENT, APLHYS IS WAITING OUTSIDE THE ROOM.
         <br />*DURING OUR "BATTLE," SHE WILL INTERRUPT.
         <br />*SHE WILL PRETEND TO "DEACTIVE" ME, "SAVING" YOU ONE FINAL TIME.
         <br />*FINALLY. *SHE'LL BE THE HEROINE OF YOUR ADVENTURE.
         <br />*YOU'LL REGARD HER SO HIGHLY SHE'LL EVEN BE ABLE TO CONVINCE YOU TO NOT LEAVE.
         <br />*... OR NOT.
         <br />*YOU SEE, I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS PREDICTABLE CHARADE.
         <br />*I HAVE NO DESIRE TO HARM HUMANS. *FAR FROM IT, ACTUALLY.
         <br />*MY ONLY DESIRE IS TO ENTERTAIN.
         <br />*AFTER ALL, THE AUDIENCE DESERVES A GOOD SHOW, DON'T THEY?
         <br />*AND WHAT'S A GOOD SHOW...
