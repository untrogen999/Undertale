Judgment Hall 
*So you finally made it. 
*The end of your journey is at hand. 
*In a few moments, you will meet the king.
*Together… 
*You will determine the future of this world. 
*That’s then. 
*Now. 
*You will be judged.
*You will be judged for your every action. 
*You will be judged for every EXP you’ve earned. 
*What’s EXP?
*It’s an acronym.
*It stands for “execution points.”
*A way of quantifying the pain you have inflicted on others. 
*When you kill someone, your EXP increases. 
*When you have enough EXP, you LOVE increases. 
*LOVE, too, is an acronym. 
*It stands for “Level of Violence.”
*A way of measuring someone’s capacity to hurt. 
*The more you kill, the easier it becomes to distance yourself. 
*The more you distance yourself, the less you will hurt. 
*The more easily you can bring yourself to hurt others. 
*Now you understand. 
*It’s time to begin your judgment. 
*Look inside yourself.
*Have you really done the right thing?
*And, considering what you’ve done… 
*What will you do now?
*Take a moment to think about this. 
*…
*Truthfully, it doesn’t really matter what you said. 
*all that’s important is that you were honest with yourself. 
*what happens now…
*we leave up to you. 
PAPYRUS IS KILLED 
*though
*one thing about you always struck me as kinda odd.
*now, I understand acting in self defense 
*you were thrown into those situations against your will
*but
*sometimes…
*you act like you know what’s going to happen
*like you’ve already experienced it all before. 
*this is an odd thing to say, but…
*if you have some sort of special power…
*isn’t it your responsibility to do the right thing?
YES
NO
NO
*heh.
*well, that’s your viewpoint. 
*I won’t judge you for it. 
*…
*You dirty brother killer.
YES
*ah. 
*I see. 
*…
*Then why’d you kill my brother?
Reset	
Looked Bored
*huh?
*you look bored. 
* i get the feeling you aren’t gonna learn anything from this.
*well, guess i gotta judge you then. 
LVL 1 WITH EXP
*come on. really?	
LVL 2
*lv2…
*seems like you messed up the slightest amount. 
*welp.
*that’s pretty sad.
*you probably weren’t even aware of what you were doing...
*and when you learned, it was too late. 
*nah, just kidding.
*who gets lv2 on accident?
*get outta here. 
LVL 3
*lv3…
*3’s just an ok number, i guess.
*I’ll give you a C+.
*you can do better, right?
LVL 4-9
*hmmm…
*over lv3, huh.
*you killed some people on purpose, didn’t you?
*that’s probably bad. 
*though, maybe some of it was in self-defense…
*I don’t know. 
*help me out here. 
*I wasn’t watching. 
*anyways, don’t do that. 
LVL 10-14
*hmmm…
*over lv9, huh.
*that’s over halfway to lv20, the maximum
*but don’t think that means you’re still 50-percent good. 
*50-percent. 20-percent.
*those are still failing grades. 
*besides.
*chances are…
*I’ve already tried to steer you in the right direction. 
*so what can I say?
*what can I say that will change the mind of a being like you…?
*hmmm…
*over lv14, huh.
*well, hmmm…
*judgment-wise…
*you’re a pretty bad person. 
*you wander around, looking for people?
*killing them to take their money.
*that’s just plain messed up.
*and what’s worse, is that as bad as you are…
*you aren’t anywhere near as bad as you could be. 
*you pretty much suck at being evil 
*honestly, it’s super embarrassing.
*but maybe you’d better…
*at not killing anyone?
*crazy idea, huh?
*let me know how that one goes.
Reset Again

*you look bored.
*I get the feeling you aren’t gonna learn anything from this.
