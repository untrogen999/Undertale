         <br />*It's an acronym.
         <br />*It stands for "execution points."

         <br />*It stands for "Level of Violence."
         <br />*A way of measuring someone's capacity to hurt.
         <br />*The more you kill, the easier it becomes to distance yourself.
         <br />*The more you distance yourself, the less you will hurt.

         <br />*...

         <br />*you were thrown into those situations against your will.

         <br />*this is an odd thing to say, but...
         <br />*if you have some sort of special power...
         <br />*isn't it your responsibility to do the right thing?
         <br />*heh.
