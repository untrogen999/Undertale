            <span class="mono">
                <p>Also Known As:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>FLOWERY (Papyrus)</li>
                </ul>
            </span>
            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <span class="mono">
                <p>He is the first major character that the protagonist encounters in Undertale.</p>
                <p>Flowey serves as the main antagonist for the majority of the game, especially in the Neutral and True Pacifist routes,</p>
                    <p>and can be considered a secondary main character for the Genocide Route. He provides an introduction </p>
                <p>to the mechanics by the "friendliness pellets," which are actually harmful bullets,</p>
                <p>revealing his philosophy of "KILL or BE KILLED". </p>
            </span>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <span class="mono"> 
                <p>Flowey has the appearance of a golden flower. He </p>
                <p>has a white center, yellow petals, and a light-green stem.</p>
                <p>Flowey can change his face to show various expressions and can mimic the faces and voices</p>
                <p>of other characters. He mimics Toriel and Asgore in some situations, as well as his</p>
                <p>old self at the end of the Genocide Route. He also mimics the protagonist's face</p>
               <p> before the Neutral Route's final battle.</p> </span>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <span class="mono">
                <p>When protagonist first meets Flowey, he hides under a facade of friendliness and politeness.</p>
                <p>He often greets the you with southern slang, such as "Howdy!", calls himself "your best friend,"</p>
                <p>and he uses polite words such as "gosh" and "golly" to the ends of his sentences.</p>
                <p>Whenever he drops his disguised friendliness, he often calls the protagonist an "idiot."</p> 
                <p>Flowey is malevolent and cruel, yelling the protagonist for not following his "kill or be killed" philosophy.</p>
                <p>He also criticizes the protagonist at the end of the Ruins if they killed any monster.</p>
