         <br />*There is only one solution to this.
         <br />*Prove yourself...
         <br />*Prove to me you are strong enough to survive.
         <br />*That is right.
         <br />*Go upstairs.
         <br />*Already?
         <br />*What will it take for you to learn your lesson?
         
         
         <br />*If you truly wish to leave the RUINS...
         <br />*I will not stop you.
         <br />*However, when you leave...
         <br />*Please do not come back.
         <br />*I hope you understand.
         <br />*Goodbye, my child.
         
         <br />*There is only one solution to this.
         <br />*Prove to me you are strong enough to survive!
         <br />*... wait.
         <br />*... why are you looking at me like that?
         <br />*Like you have seen a ghost.
         <br />Do you know something that I do not?
         <br />*No... *That is impossible.

         <br />*Clever. *Verrrryyy clever.
         <br />*You think you're really smart, don't you?
         <br />*In this world, it's kill or be killed.
         <br />*So you were able to play by your own rules.
         <br />*You spared the life of a single person.
         <br />*Hee hee hee...
         <br />*I bet you feel really great.
         <br />*You didn't kill anybody this time.
         <br />*But what will you do if you meet a relentless killer?
         <br />*You'll die and you'll die and you'll die.
         <br />*Until you tire of trying.
         <br />*What will you do then?
         <br />*Will you kill out of frustration?
         <br />*Or will you give up entirely on this world...
         <br />*...and let ME inherit the power to control it?
         <br />*I am the prince of this world's future.
         <br />*Don't worry my little monarch, my plan isn't regicide.
         <br />*This is SO much more interesting.
